This repository contains MATLAB files for the simulation of a 2D ising model (by metropolis monte carlo algorithm) to study changes in its properties with respect to the change in temperature.

This is an ongoing project, there might be some issues/bugs in the files.
# 2D Ising Model Simulations
*The folder `2D_ising` contains MATLAB files (.m) for the 2D ising model simulation of variable lattice size with periodic boundry conditions. 

*The folder `2D_critical_exp` contains MATLAB files (.m) for the estimation of the critical exponents of the 2D Ising model with varying Lattice size.

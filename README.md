This repository contains MATLAB files for the simulation of a 2D ising model (by metropolis monte carlo algorithm) to study changes in its thermodynamic properties with respect to the change in temperature.

This is an ongoing project, there might be some issues/bugs in the files.
# 2D Ising Model Simulations
The folder `2D_ising` contains MATLAB files (.m) for the 2D ising model simulation of variable lattice size.

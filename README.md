This project is for the simulation of a 2D ising model (by Metropolis monte carlo algorithm) to study its properties.

This is an ongoing project, there might be some issues/bugs in the files.
# 2D Ising Model Simulations
*All the simulation codes are using single spin flip dynamics only.* 
-The folder `2DIsing_criticalexponents` contains MATLAB files (.m) for generating the plots of critical exponenets vs Lattice Size.
-The folder `2DIsing_Fs` contains code files for estimating surface tension by method of probabality distribution.
-THe folder `2DIsing_phasetransition` contains code files for generating the plots of Average magnetisation, Average Energy, susceptibility and heat capacity vs Temperature.
-The folder `2DIsing_probability_distribution` contains code files for estimating distribution of 2D ising states by varying order parameter and using simple counting method.
